# Community Warning
Please do not use toastering's own compilation as whenever I compiled it myself, the file size was significantly lower and had less detections on VirusTotal. **THEY MAY HAVE ADDED MALWARE**

# Side Note
You may need to install the latest [vc-redist](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/windows/latest-supported-vc-redist?view=msvc-170) and even Visual Studio Community with the c++ package to run this

# Basic Pros
-Physics are still calculated normally using your fps, usually ~60 fps unless you unlock your fps.\
\
-No rendering.\
\
-No hassle with raknet, all networking is already done for you because it's a real game client.\
\
-Compatible with multiple game clients.\
\
-Exploits work with it, allowing for easy bots and autofarming that use little to no resources.
# Basic Cons
-No anti-afk is implemented, user will timeout from inactivity, an exploit and a script with antiafk for example infinite yield is required.\
\
-Unintentionally has the ability to hide the process from task manager, seems to be rare.\
