\
-No rendering.\
\
-No hassle with raknet, all networking is already done for you because it's a real game client.\
\
-Compatible with multiple game clients.\
\
-Exploits work with it, allowing for easy bots and autofarming that use little to no resources.

-No anti-afk is implemented, user will timeout from inactivity, an exploit and a script with antiafk for example infinite yield is required.\

-In order to unhide the game client window(s) you have to use something like process hacker to edit window visibilty or manually restart/terminate the game client.
